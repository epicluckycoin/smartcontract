# Epic Lucky Coin (ELC)
An epic lucky coin is a coin that is not particularly useful for transferring tokens, 
as you never know how many tokens you transfer. 

However, if you get lucky, you may end up with more tokens than before. Here are the rules

##Minting

The exchange rate is 1 ETH = 10'000 ELC, however, with a 50% change you get 20'000 ELC and if you
are unlucky, you get 5'000 ELC

E.g., if Alice sends Bob 100 ELC, Alice gets 100 ELC deducted, while Bob may receive 
either 50 ELC or 200 ELC, depending on the block hash (which is fairly random).

## Short Summary
 * Name: Epic Lucky Coin
 * Symbol: ELC
 * Max Tokens: 10'000'000
 * Decimal Points: 2
 * Exchange Rate: 1 ETH = 10'000 ELC
 * ERC20 standard
 
## Limitations
The value in both transfer methods are not what you expect. Depending on the block
hash its either half the value, or double the value. In 10% of the cases the value
is a value from a previous transfer - completely unusable. 

## Caution
This is a fun coin, that was invented for a secret santa gift exchange purpose. The goal 
was find a useless coin. Since this coin is useless in reliable transferring values, its 
still fun to your transferred funds double (or halve). This coin has many testcases and 
has been rigorously tested, thus, I'm fairly certain that this coin is bug free.
